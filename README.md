# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Description  
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of medical attributes. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze a publicly available dataset to build a classification model that can assist in early diagnosis.

## Problem Statement  
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and prevention. The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant indicators.

## Motivation  
We chose this dataset because heart disease remains a major public health issue, and accurate predictive models can support medical professionals in making timely and informed decisions. By applying machine learning to real-world data, we gain valuable experience in solving practical problems while contributing to potential healthcare improvements.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Kaggle â€“ [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)  
- **Description**: The dataset contains several features related to patient health, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and others. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.
